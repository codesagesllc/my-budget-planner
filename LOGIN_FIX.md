# 🚀 Quick Fix for Login Issues

## You have everything configured! Just need to:

### 1. Restart Your Dev Server
```powershell
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### 2. Check Database Setup
Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ftnihylyezhlzzvolltr/sql/new

Run this to check if tables exist:
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
```

If you see NO tables, run the migration SQL from:
`supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`

### 3. Quick Test Commands

**Option A: Test Sign Up (Recommended)**
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/signup
2. Use a NEW email (e.g., test@example.com)
3. Password: test123
4. Should auto-login after signup

**Option B: Check Existing Users**
Go to Supabase SQL Editor and run:
```sql
-- See all registered users
SELECT * FROM auth.users;

-- Check if user profiles exist
SELECT * FROM public.users;
```

### 4. For Google Login (Optional)

**Quick Setup:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ftnihylyezhlzzvolltr/auth/providers
2. Enable Google provider
3. Add Google OAuth credentials (see AUTH_SETUP.md for details)

## Common Fixes:

### ❌ "Invalid authentication credentials"
- Tables not created → Run migration SQL
- Wrong credentials → Check `.env.local`

### ❌ "User already registered" 
- Email already used → Try different email
- Or login instead of signup

### ❌ Login works but doesn't redirect
```powershell
# Clear everything and restart
Remove-Item .next -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
npm run dev
```

### ❌ Can't see debug logs
Open browser console (F12) and check for errors

## Your Current Status:
- ✅ Supabase project connected
- ✅ Service role key configured  
- ✅ npm audit: 0 vulnerabilities
- ✅ App running at http://localhost:3000
- ⚠️ Need to verify database tables exist
- ⚠️ Need to create first user account

## Test Right Now:
1. Open: http://localhost:3000/signup
2. Create account with any email
3. Should redirect to dashboard after signup

The app is working! You just need to create your first account. 😊
