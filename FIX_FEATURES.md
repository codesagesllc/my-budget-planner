# üîß Fix for Bank Connection & Bill Upload

## Quick Fix Steps:

### 1. Clean Reinstall (Fix Package Issues)
```powershell
# Stop your dev server (Ctrl+C)

# Clean everything
Remove-Item node_modules -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item package-lock.json -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item .next -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Install fresh
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Start server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Bank Connection
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard
2. Click "Connect Bank Account" button
3. Use Plaid sandbox credentials:
   - Username: `user_good`
   - Password: `pass_good`

### 3. Test Bill Upload
1. Click "Upload Bills Spreadsheet" button
2. Download the CSV template first
3. Edit it with your bills
4. Upload the CSV file
5. AI will parse and import your bills

## What Was Fixed:

### ‚úÖ Plaid Connection
- Fixed API route to handle missing user profiles
- Added automatic profile creation
- Better error handling and logging

### ‚úÖ Bill Upload
- Simplified file reading (no more ExcelJS issues)
- Better CSV support (recommended format)
- Improved AI parsing with error handling
- Fixed package conflicts

### ‚úÖ Dashboard UI
- Better button layout with cards
- Clear action sections
- Upload modal for bills

## If Issues Persist:

### Check Database Tables
Go to Supabase SQL Editor and run:
```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- If no tables, run the migration from:
-- supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql
```

### Check Console Logs
Press F12 in browser and check for errors in:
- Console tab (JavaScript errors)
- Network tab (API failures)

### Test API Directly
Visit: http://localhost:3000/api/test

Should show:
```json
{
  "status": "connected",
  "database": { "connected": true }
}
```

## Testing Files:

### Sample CSV Content
Save this as `bills.csv`:
```csv
Bill Name,Amount,Due Date,Billing Cycle,Category
Netflix,15.99,1,monthly,Entertainment
Electric Company,120,5,monthly,Utilities
Internet,70,15,monthly,Utilities
Car Insurance,150,20,monthly,Insurance
Gym,50,1,monthly,Health
```

### Your Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Authentication working (Google login successful!)
- ‚úÖ Dashboard loading
- ‚úÖ API routes fixed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to test with database tables created
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to upload a CSV file to test

## Next Steps:
1. Run clean install commands above
2. Make sure database tables exist in Supabase
3. Try uploading the sample CSV
4. Connect a Plaid sandbox account

Everything should work now! The main issues were:
- Package conflicts (fixed by removing buffer)
- Missing user profiles (fixed with auto-creation)
- File parsing issues (simplified to CSV-first approach)
